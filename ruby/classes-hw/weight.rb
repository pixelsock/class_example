# Extra practice:
#
# A gym has hired you to solve a problem. Most of their clients are fairly new to
#weightlifting and donâ€™t know what to put on the barbell for a particular weight.
#The weights they have made available are in 45, 35, 25, 15, 10 and 5 lb weights. increments.
#Build them a Ruby application that will tell them, for a given weight, what plates
#to put on each side of the bar. Bear in mind that the bar itself weighs 45 lb weights.
#
# For example, if they want to load 225 lb weights. on the bar, they will need to put two 45 lb weights.
#plates on each side of the bar. 45x4 = 180 lb weights. Plus 45 lb weights. for the barbell itself equals a total of 225 lb weights.
#
# Hint: You don't really need to create Objects for this one, so you get a break from that. But you will need to create methods!
